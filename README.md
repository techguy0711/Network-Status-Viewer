# Network-Status-Viewer
Demonstrates in a JavaFX program how powerful Socket programming can be.
This Application takes advantage of the Socket API provided by Oracle natively in the java Platform.
Using JavaFX we display some useful information about the Server Socket or modem. 
Just enter in an IP Address and Port, and run report. 
Once report has ran you can save report to a CSV (Comma Seperated File) file, or clear the fields and run another report.
Keep in mind that you can comunicate with any device that has a Server Socket, or behaves like a Server Socket,
such as a modem, or TC/IP router.
If you are connecting to a modem or router most common port is 80, or rarely 443.
NOte: This application is constructed mainly arround JavaFX.

If you have any questions let me know. I have had java and networking experience since 2009.
